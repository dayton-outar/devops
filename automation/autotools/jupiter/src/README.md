# How this _Makefile.am_ works

Here’s a breakdown of the instructions in the provided `Makefile.am`:

```
SUBDIRS = modules/hithere

bin_PROGRAMS = jupiter
jupiter_SOURCES = main.c module.h
jupiter_CPPFLAGS = -I$(top_srcdir)/include
jupiter_LDADD = ../libjup/libjupiter.la -dlopen modules/hithere/hithere.la
```

Here’s a breakdown of the provided `Makefile.am`:

1. `SUBDIRS = modules/hithere`
- **Definition**: This line specifies the subdirectories that will be processed during the build.
- **Explanation**: The variable `SUBDIRS` lists the directories containing additional `Makefile.am` files that should be built. In this case, `modules/hithere` is specified, meaning that Automake will navigate into this directory and process its `Makefile.am` (if it exists) as part of the build process.

2. `bin_PROGRAMS = jupiter`
- **Definition**: This line indicates that a program named `jupiter` will be built and installed in the `bin` directory.
- **Explanation**: The variable `bin_PROGRAMS` lists the executable programs that will be generated by the build process. Here, `jupiter` is specified, meaning that the build system will create an executable named `jupiter`.

3. `jupiter_SOURCES = main.c module.h`
- **Definition**: This line specifies the source files for the `jupiter` program.
- **Explanation**: The variable `jupiter_SOURCES` lists the C source files and headers used to build the `jupiter` executable. In this case, `main.c` is the source file, and `module.h` is a header file that will be included during compilation.

4. `jupiter_CPPFLAGS = -I$(top_srcdir)/include`
- **Definition**: This line defines additional flags for the C preprocessor used during the compilation of `jupiter`.
- **Explanation**: The variable `jupiter_CPPFLAGS` sets preprocessor flags for the compilation of the `jupiter` program. The `-I` flag specifies an include directory:
  - `-I$(top_srcdir)/include`: This tells the compiler to look for header files in the `include` directory at the top level of the source directory (referenced by `$(top_srcdir)`).
- This allows `main.c` and `module.h` to reference other headers located in that directory.

5. `jupiter_LDADD = ../libjup/libjupiter.la -dlopen modules/hithere/hithere.la`
- **Definition**: This line specifies the libraries that the `jupiter` program should link against.
- **Explanation**: The variable `jupiter_LDADD` lists the libraries to be linked when building the `jupiter` executable:
  - `../libjup/libjupiter.la`: This indicates that the `jupiter` program will be linked with the shared library `libjupiter.la` located in the `libjup` directory, which is one level up from the current directory.
  - `-dlopen modules/hithere/hithere.la`: This option is used to link with the `hithere.la` library located in the `modules/hithere` directory. The `-dlopen` flag allows for dynamic loading of the library at runtime.
  
## Summary

In summary, this `Makefile.am` defines the build process for the `jupiter` executable, specifying its source files, include paths, and libraries for linking. Additionally, it instructs the build system to process a subdirectory, ensuring that any components in `modules/hithere` are also included in the overall build.
